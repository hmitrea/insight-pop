## What is the page about

Breaking it up can make it more readable, especially for those who skim through documentation. Here's a suggestion:

This is a playful project that introduces an interactive chatbox feature. Imagine being on a website and wanting to share feedback with its creators. With this chatbox, you can easily jot down your suggestions and relay them directly to the founders.

There are several components still in progress:

- Testing.
- One specific component.
- The event handler for the send button.

However, the primary objective has been achieved: to introduce the main chatbox feature. To view or hide the chatbox, click the plus/minus button located at the bottom right corner. Screenshots will be provided

Feel free to look at the code and use it if needed it.
